This project is a way for me to learn computer vision along with bits of AI so what better way to learn than by automating something you like to play! :D

This program will eventually automate the whole process of farming super credits. It will only work for the trivial and easy difficulties (1 and 2)

My plan on how to automate it is as follows:

    - find points of interest using the map in the bottom right corner
        - program will know what the different POIs look like on map
        - recognize them faster than the average person playing HD2

    - using keyboard/mouse, run over to the POIs it identified and collect the super credits (if any)
        - throwing grenade accurately to open some containers
        - avoiding the bugs that might be in its path
        
    - finally, it will abandon the mission, queue up the next mission, run to hellpod, and select the appropriate stratagem
        - know when all POIs have been found and abandon the mission
        - prioritizing missions that will make it easier to avoid groups of enemies (mainly bugs for now)
